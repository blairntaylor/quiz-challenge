# quiz-challenge

In this homework we were asked to make a pretty comprehensive coding quiz.

The HTML body is built and links to a css stylesheet and a script javascript doc.

The start button is working and starts the timer and the user is presented with the first question and answer choices. The main code block with the introductioon becomes hidden and the question function appears which lists the code quiz and answers.

The timer and score are visible. The timer is working but the view high score is not.

This part of the homework took quite a big of troubleshooting. I had trouble deciding and then calling classes and ids. Also, using hidden features on my ids.

<<<<<< This part of the quiz is not completed. >>>>>

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
